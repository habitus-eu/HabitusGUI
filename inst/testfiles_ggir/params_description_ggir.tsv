parameter	topic	description
windowsizes	general	Numeric vector of sizes for the epoch, non-wear detection resolution, and and non-wear detection window.
desiredtz	general	Character with the timezone name according to the timezone database
idloc	general	Number to tell GGIR how the participant identifier should be extracted: idloc = 1 (default) the code assumes that ID number is stored in the  obvious header field. Note that for ActiGraph data the ID is never stored in the file  header.  For idloc value set to 2, 5, 6, and 7, GGIR looks at the filename and extracts the     character string preceding the first occurance of a '_', ' ' (space), '.' (dot),     and '-', respecitvely.
colid	sleep	Column number in the sleep log spreadsheet in which the participant ID code is stored (default = 1) 
coln1	sleep	Column number in the sleep log spreadsheet where the onset of the first night starts
criterror	sleep	Relevant for do.visual == TRUE and outliers.only == TRUE. criterror specifies the number of minimum number of hours difference between sleep log and accelerometer estimate for the night to be included in the visualisation 
do.visual	sleep	If g.part4 is run with do.visual == TRUE then the function will generate a pdf with a visual representation of the overlap between the sleeplog entries and the accelerometer detections. This can be used to visualy verify that the sleeplog entries do not come with obvious mistakes.
excludefirstlast	sleep	If TRUE then the first and last night of the measurement are ignored for the sleep assessment.
includenightcrit	sleep	Minimum number of valid hours per night (24 hour window between noon and noon)
nnights	sleep	Number of nights for which sleep log information should be available. It assumes that this is constant within a study. If sleep log information is missing for certain nights then leave these blank
outliers.only	sleep	Relevant for do.visual == TRUE. Outliers.only == FALSE will visualise all available nights in the data. Outliers.only == TRUE will visualise only for nights with a difference in onset or waking time larger than the variable of argument criterror.
sleeplogidnum	sleep	Boolean to indicate whether the participant identifier as stored in the sleeplog should be interpretted as a number (TRUE=default) or a character (FALSE)?
boutcriter.in	physical activity	A number between 0 and 1 and defines what fraction of a bout needs to be below the light threshold 
boutcriter.lig	physical activity	A number between 0 and 1 and defines what fraction of a bout needs to be between the light and moderage threshold
boutcriter.mvpa	physical activity	A number between 0 and 1 and defines what fraction of a bout needs to be above the mvpathreshold
boutdur.in	physical activity	Durations of inactivty bouts in minutes to be extracted. Inactivity bouts are detected in the segments of the data which were not labelled as sleep or MVPA bouts. The default duration values is c(10,20,30), this will start with the identification of 30 minute bouts, followed by 20 minute bouts in the rest of the data, and followed by 10 minute bouts in the rest of the data
boutdur.lig	physical activity	Durations of light activty bouts in minutes to be extracted. Light activity bouts are detected in the segments of the data which were not labelled as sleep, MVPA, or inactivity bouts. The default duration values is c(1,5,10), this will start with the identification of 10 minute bouts, followed by 5 minute bouts in the rest of the data, and followed by 1 minute bouts in the rest of the data
boutdur.mvpa	physical activity	Durations of mvpa bouts in minutes to be extracted. The default values is c(1,5,10) and will start with the identification of 10 minute bouts, followed by 5 minute bouts in the rest of the data, and followed by 1 minute bouts in the rest of the data.
threshold.lig	physical activity	Threshold for light physical activity to separate inactivity from light. Value can be one number or an array of multiple numbers, e.g. threshold.lig =c(30,40). If multiple numbers are entered then analysis will be repliced for each combination of threshold values. Threshold is applied to the first metric in the milestone data, so if you have only specified do.ENMO == TRUE then it will be applied to ENMO.
threshold.mod	physical activity	Threshold for moderate physical activity to separate light from moderate. Value can be one number or an array of multiple numbers, e.g. threshold.mod =c(100,110). If multiple numbers are entered then analysis will be repliced for each ombination of threshold values. Threshold is applied to the first metric in the milestone data, so if you have only specified do.ENMO == TRUE then it will be applied to ENMO.
threshold.vig	physical activity	Threshold for vigorous physical activity to separate moderate from vigorous. Value can be one number or an array of multiple numbers, e.g. threshold.mod=c(400,500). If multiple numbers are entered then analysis will be repliced for each combination of threshold values. Threshold is applied to the first metric in the milestone data, so if you have only specified do.ENMO == TRUE then it will be applied to ENMO.
